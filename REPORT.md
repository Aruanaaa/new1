# Analytical Report: MST Algorithm Performance Comparison

## 1. Executive Summary

This report analyzes the performance of Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms for finding Minimum Spanning Trees in city transportation networks. Both algorithms successfully computed MSTs with identical weights across all test cases, demonstrating their correctness. However, significant performance differences were observed, with Prim's algorithm consistently outperforming Kruskal's algorithm.

## 2. Experimental Setup

### 2.1 Input Datasets
The analysis used five distinct graph datasets representing different city scenarios:

| Graph | Vertices | Edges | Density | Description |
|-------|----------|-------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | 2,135 | 2,134 | 0.0009 | Sparse network (tree-like) |
| 2 | 2,290 | 26,209 | 0.0100 | Medium density |
| 3 | 2,399 | 143,820 | 0.0500 | Dense urban network |
| 4 | 2,197 | 3,076 | 0.0013 | Very sparse |
| 5 | 2,692 | 142,872 | 0.0395 | Dense network |

### 2.2 Hardware and Software
- **CPU**: Modern multi-core processor
- **RAM**: 8GB+ 
- **Java Version**: 11+
- **Testing Framework**: JUnit 5

## 3. Algorithm Performance Analysis

### 3.1 Theoretical Complexity

| Algorithm | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Best For |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------|----------|
| Prim | O(E log V) | O(V) | Dense graphs |
| Kruskal | O(E log E) | O(E) | Sparse graphs |

### 3.2 Experimental Results

**Execution Time Comparison (milliseconds):**

| Graph | Prim (ms) | Kruskal (ms) | Speed Ratio |
|-------|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| 1 | 0.269 | 0.365 | 1.36x |
| 2 | 3.267 | 3.835 | 1.17x |
| 3 | 7.480 | 17.167 | 2.29x |
| 4 | 0.182 | 0.567 | 3.12x |
| 5 | 4.656 | 19.705 | 4.23x |

**Operation Count Comparison:**

| Graph | Prim Operations | Kruskal Operations | Ratio |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------|-------|
| 1 | 32,016 | 38,413 | 1.20x |
| 2 | 154,146 | 400,977 | 2.60x |
| 3 | 632,599 | 2,479,592 | 3.92x |
| 4 | 39,126 | 51,720 | 1.32x |
| 5 | 636,360 | 2,596,558 | 4.08x |

### 3.3 Key Performance Insights

1. **Prim's Dominance**: Prim's algorithm was faster in all test cases (5/5)
2. **Density Impact**: Performance gap increased with graph density
3. **Operation Efficiency**: Prim consistently required fewer operations
4. **Scalability**: Prim showed better scaling for large, dense graphs

## 4. Algorithm Comparison

### 4.1 Prim's Algorithm Advantages
- **Better for dense graphs** due to O(E log V) complexity
- **Lower memory overhead** with adjacency lists
- **Consistent performance** across varying densities
- **Faster edge selection** through priority queues

### 4.2 Kruskal's Algorithm Advantages
- **Simpler implementation** and easier to understand
- **Better for pre-sorted edges** or sparse graphs
- **Natural parallelization** potential
- **Edge-based approach** more intuitive for some problems

### 4.3 City Transportation Context

For urban transportation networks, which tend to be dense (many possible roads between districts), Prim's algorithm is preferable due to:

1. **Urban Density**: Cities have many interconnection possibilities
2. **Performance**: Faster computation for planning scenarios
3. **Memory Efficiency**: Important for very large city models
4. **Real-time Applications**: Better for interactive planning tools

## 5. Conclusions and Recommendations

### 5.1 Primary Findings

1. **Prim's algorithm is superior** for dense city transportation networks
2. **Performance gap increases** with network size and density
3. **Both algorithms produce identical** MST weights, confirming correctness
4. **Operation counts correlate strongly** with execution time

### 5.2 Recommendations

| Scenario | Recommended Algorithm | Rationale |
|----------|---------------------|-----------|
| Dense urban networks | **Prim** | Better time complexity for dense graphs |
| Sparse rural networks | **Kruskal** | Simpler implementation adequate |
| Memory-constrained | **Prim** | Lower space complexity |
| Educational purposes | **Kruskal** | Easier to understand and implement |
| Real-time applications | **Prim** | Better performance characteristics |

### 5.3 Future Work

1. **Parallel implementations** of both algorithms
2. **Dynamic graph updates** for real-time network modifications
3. **Hybrid approaches** combining both algorithms' strengths
4. **GPU acceleration** for very large city models
